## About Me

Hello, I am currently a PhD student at [SpaceTimeLab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/spacetimelab), [CEGE](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/), [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), co-supervised by [Prof. Tao Cheng](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/prof-tao-cheng) and [Dr. Stephen Law](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/21695-stephen-law). I was first exposed to scientific research during my master's study, where I was supervised by [Prof. Huayi Wu](http://www.lmars.whu.edu.cn/prof_web/why/index.html) and [Prof. Xuefeng Guan](https://liesmars.whu.edu.cn/info/1167/5936.htm) and finished my first research project, which is about deep learning-based short-term traffic forecasting. After that, my interests in deep learning and graph neural networks took me to SpaceTimeLab, where my research expanded into many fields in urban analytics. Over the past few years, I have worked on several data-driven projects, including UK high street footfall analysis, mobile location data-based human activity profiling, LLM-based human mobility prediction, and representation learning of urban spaces. 

Looking forward, I will continue focusing on developing computational method for various urban analytics problems/tasks and investigating fundamental problems in GeoAI. 

I am open to collaborations and external opportunities. Apart from my current supervisors, my other collaborators include [Dr. Meng Fang](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/meng-fang) and [Dr. Lu Yin](http://luuyin.com/). I have also been working closely with my fellow PhD students here at UCL, including [Zichao Zeng](https://www.zengzichao.com/), [Junyuan Liu](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/junyuan-liu-8604b9251), [Natchapon Jongwiriyanurak](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/79254-natchapon-jongwiriyanurak), [June Moh Goo](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/96956-june-moh-goo), [Ilya Ilyankou](https://ilyankou.com/), and [Xianghui Zhang](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/79532-xianghui-zhang/about), to name a few.
